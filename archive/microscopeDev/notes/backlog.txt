    []Model 2: multiple frames that checks each step in a scene (Model 2 is unordered)
    []Ensure "unsupervised" actions don't leave game unprogressable.
    []Moving lenses (with resets the blur), coarse gets stuck and fine inactive
[]Add warnings/additional text
    []Too high of aperture light will be blinding (on low mag)
    []Too far movement of knobs may blur view.
[] "(see details)" on instruction tooltip for clarity if extra details necessary to proceed.
[] Once at 40X, coarse knob should trigger warning (may damage slide)
			****If they touch coarse focus on 40X, trigger large warning.
[] For quizzes, call the post at the very end after inputting all the answers in an array to call it once.
[] Currently unable to make questions for Cell Count. need pictures and specifically which magnification we need to use.
	[] enable use of microscope during cell count.
[] Review gh-pages branch and notice the new bugs
